Art on View

Mission: to make art accessible in San Francisco and New York City museums on a single web page application

The application uses Ruby on Rails.  Please have it installed in advance.

Run the code by doing the following:
- fork into your own account
- git clone via ssh in your terminal
- bundle install in your terminal
- heroku run rake db:seed
- heroku run rake db:migrate
- heroku open
